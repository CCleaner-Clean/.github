With CCleaner, users can:
- Clean browsing history, cookies, and cache from popular browsers.
- Remove temporary files and logs from system and applications.
- Fix registry errors to prevent system crashes and errors.
- Manage startup programs to speed up boot time.
- Uninstall programs completely and securely.

Used by millions worldwide, CCleaner is especially popular among gamers, streamers, and professionals who require a fast and stable system. Its intuitive interface and powerful cleaning capabilities make it a must-have utility for Windows users.
